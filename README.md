**SNR Analyzer Tool**

Developed using PyQt5 in Python, the SNR Analyzer Tool facilitates the analysis of neural network layer performance by evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It empowers users to select a JSON file containing SNR data, presents layers sorted by their SNR, and furnishes comprehensive insights into each layer and its modules.

**Features:**
- **Select JSON File:** Choose a JSON file with SNR data via a file dialog.
- **Display Sorted Layers:** Present layers in a list view, sorted from highest to lowest total SNR.
- **View Layer Details:** Access detailed information about each layer and its modules, including SNR values, by clicking on a specific layer.

**Usage:**
1. Launch the application.
2. Click the "Select JSON File" button to designate a JSON file with SNR data.
3. Upon file selection, the tool showcases layers organized by SNR.
4. Click on a layer to delve into detailed module information and corresponding SNR values.

**Note:** Ensure the JSON file adheres to the correct format, including accurate module names and corresponding SNR values.
